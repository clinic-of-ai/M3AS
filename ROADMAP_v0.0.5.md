- [ ] Coding agent workflows and tools function correctly
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work (backward compatibility)

### Functional Requirements (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] All backends work reliably with comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Backend switching and fallback mechanisms function correctly
- [ ] Conversation save/load and export features work seamlessly

### Performance Requirements (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Coding agents maintain <2s response times
- [ ] Memory usage remains efficient for coding workflows

### Performance Requirements (OPTIONAL)  
- [ ] Backend health checks complete in <500ms
- [ ] Configuration validation completes instantly

### Quality Requirements (REQUIRED)
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for coding agent features
- [ ] Zero regressions in existing multi-turn and coordination behavior
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for coding agent setup and usage

### Quality Requirements (OPTIONAL)
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation with production deployment guides
- [ ] User-friendly error messages and configuration validation

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Existing Backends**: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and Grok backend foundation
- **Multi-Turn Architecture**: Current conversation context system
- **Configuration System**: YAML/JSON configuration management
- **Test Infrastructure**: Existing comprehensive test suite

### Risks & Mitigations
1. **Backend Reliability**: *Mitigation*: Comprehensive error handling and health monitoring
2. **Coding Agent Integration Complexity**: *Mitigation*: Dedicated testing and validation frameworks
3. **Configuration Complexity**: *Mitigation*: Validation tools and interactive setup wizard
4. **Backward Compatibility**: *Mitigation*: Extensive regression testing
5. **Production Deployment**: *Mitigation*: Clear deployment guides and monitoring tools

## Post-v0.0.5 Considerations

### Future Enhancements (v0.0.6+)
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based conversation interface
- **API Server**: RESTful API for third-party integrations
- **Advanced Analytics**: Conversation insights and optimization suggestions
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Image and file handling in conversations

### Long-term Vision
- **Enterprise Features**: Team collaboration, conversation sharing
- **Plugin System**: Extensible agent capabilities
- **Cloud Integration**: Hosted MassGen service
- **Advanced AI Features**: Auto-summarization, intelligent routing

## Timeline Summary

| Week | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Coding agent integration | Claude Code CLI, Gemini CLI implementation and testing |
| 2 | Backend enhancements (optional) | Error handling, health checks, additional providers |
